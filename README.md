# Project 3: Dog and Cat Image Classification Using CNN

# 1. Project Content
This project focuses on detecting whether an image contains a dog or a cat using a machine learning model. It involves loading datasets, preprocessing images, training a model, and evaluating its accuracy.

# 2. Project Code

~~~python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set image dimensions and paths
IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH = 150, 150
BATCH_SIZE = 32

# Data preprocessing and augmentation
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, validation_split=0.2)

train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'path_to_dataset',
    target_size=(IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH),
    batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
    class_mode='binary',
    subset='training'
)

validation_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'path_to_dataset',
    target_size=(IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH),
    batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
    class_mode='binary',
    subset='validation'
)

# Building the CNN model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training the model
history = model.fit(
    train_generator,
    validation_data=validation_generator,
    epochs=10
)

# Plotting accuracy and loss
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Train Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# 3. Key Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Deep Learning (CNN)

# 4. Description
The goal of the project is to develop a classification model that can accurately distinguish between dog and cat images. The dataset is split into training and validation sets, with images being resized and normalized. A CNN model is constructed with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers. The model is trained using binary crossentropy as the loss function and accuracy as the metric.

# 5. Output
- Accuracy and loss plots
- Example predictions on validation/test images showing whether the image is classified as a dog or a cat
- Final model accuracy

# 6. Further Research
- Improve accuracy using more advanced architectures like ResNet, Inception, or EfficientNet
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
- Implement transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Expand to multi-class classification including more animal types
- Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
